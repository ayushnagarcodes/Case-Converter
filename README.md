# Case Converter
You can see the live preview of this project [here](https://ayushnagarcodes.github.io/Case-Converter/).
- I created this case converter project which can change the text entered to UPPER CASE, lower case, Proper Case or Sentence case.
- You can also download the text converted as a .txt file.
- Additionally, you can change the background, toggle between light and dark mode, and more by clicking on the icons at the left.
- There are 3 versions of it and each version has both light and dark modes.
